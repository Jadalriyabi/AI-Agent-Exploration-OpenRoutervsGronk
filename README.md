# AI-Agent-Workshop
In this workshop, I learnt how to build an AI agent with Llama 3.1 that matches the reasoning capabilities of OpenAIâ€™s new model, o1. The workshop will cover the key components of building an agent: a planner, reasoner, executor, and evaluator, all with short and long-term memory.
